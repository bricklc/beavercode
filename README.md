# BeaverCode Project Dam

Purpose: Reusable project foundation for new projects with consistent structure and documentation.

Getting started:
1. Create a project specification document at the root of your new project.
2. Then fill in the beavercode folders (ideation, research, planning, etc.).

Required first step:
- Create a fleshed-out project specification file:
  <project-name>_Project_Specification.md

Specification template:

# <Project Name> - Project Specification

## 1. Overview
- What is the product?
- Who is it for?
- Why does it matter?

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals
Goals:
- 
Non-Goals:
- 

## 3. Core Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## 4. User Flows
- Flow 1
- Flow 2

## 5. Data Model (high level)
- Entities and relationships

## 6. Architecture
- Frontend
- Backend (if any)
- Storage

## 7. Constraints
- Platform
- Offline/online requirements
- Performance targets

## 8. Milestones
- Phase 1
- Phase 2

## 9. Risks and Open Questions
- Risk 1
- Question 1

## 10. Acceptance Criteria
- What does "done" look like?

Next steps:
- Populate current/ with status, todo, context.
- Create ideation entries for major subsystems.
- Add research papers where external references are needed.
